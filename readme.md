## Developer Resources

> Hello World! ðŸ‘‹ What was originally the introduction to this list mutated somehow into a sort of impromptu history lesson/philosophical treatise--I really don't know how the heck that happened! I was just typing away and then... **bam**! I hope it isn't received as too preachy or prescriptive: It sure wasn't intended as such. Think of it as a naiively optimistic pep talk from one student of life to another.

## Look At It This Way

### Introduction

 There are enough "getting started" how-to's, walkthroughs, tips, tricks, posts, and pages available to the aspiring developer to last a lifetime. And a lot of them are really good. I mean really, **really** good. There are free books, thousands of hours of lectures on Youtube, and thriving communities of best in class experts--often the very authors of the languages and code you've got questions about--in IRC chats, forums, subreddits, and Slack channels. 
 
 It's an extension of the ethos born with computer technology, carried and nurtured by a rebellious collective of proto-programmers, enshrined and officialized with the GNU project, the BSD, the FOSS movement, Linux, and since maintained by the countless wizards of tech, both sung and unsung, scattered across the globe and connected by the internet today.

Even with all that, it never hurts to add to the pile. My own humble resource list is more about articulating a living document for my own reference, of tools and tricks and thoughts I've come across--but in the spirit of open source knowledge I'm putting it out there in the hope that it helps even just one person who stumbles across it. If you're that person, I hope you find something that you didn't know before and that it helps you on your journey.

### Philosophy

The single greatest thing, historically speaking and imho, about computer/web/tech culture is that enthusiastic willingness of people to share software, tools, skills, and stories, with the community. A collective roadmap of how they/we got where they are. Ultimately, we're all forever indebted to the early generation of Unix, FOSS, BSD, GNU, and Linux guys for setting that tone and enshrining it--and for diligently maintaining it over the years.

A successful career in this industry requires an elasticity of intellect and a resilience in the face of insurmountable odds. It will put you in contact with so many technologies that your head will spin--at first. While daunting, you'll find your balance and a comfortable niche in the ecosystem from which to get your bearings. From there you can continue to branch out and explore the broader landscape, a process that once begun, never ends. 

There's a set of defining characteristics that make a developer/engineer great: An insatiable curiosity, a willingness to evolve over time, a tendency toward seeing problems as inherently solvable, a humility that allows them to pair the great work they do with the great work of their team, company, or the FOSS community at large, and perhaps most importantly, a steady methodical persistence in search of elegant solutions. 

While it's entirely possible to find that comfortable niche and stick with it forever, a true jedi of the art never stops absorbing evaluating and synthesizing information, never stops reading, learning, deconstructing, reconstructing, and making--even if the work they're currently doing to pay the bills is unstimulating or repetetive. They remain always in humble respect of the vastness of available knowledge out there. They recognize that the landscape is constantly moving forward, even as it remains at it's core an assembly of 0's and 1's.

### Software & Setup

There's no "right way" to set up a development environment. You find a workflow of your own over time, with hardware and software flavors that suit your particular needs. That said, there are shortcuts and tricks that, while seemingly inconsequential individually, will dramatically improve a developers productivity in aggregate. There are certainly plenty of things I wish I'd discovered months or years earlier, and to this day I'm adding, tweaking, and experimenting with my routines.

I would encourage anyone reading this to *try all the things* at least once, or at least all the highly regarded ones with large thriving communities. If you like Javascript try Python, If you like React, experiment with Vue, Angular, or Ember. If you love Jquery, build something with nothing but VanillaJS. If you're a backend developer, try converting a Sketch file into a responsive front-end UI, and if you're a die hard CSS stylist, make sure to fire up a Digital Ocean droplet, install Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, and configure a web server from scratch.

The point is not of course to derail you from a path or curriculum, or waste precious time if you're in the middle of a project with a deadline--on the contrary, you should do those things when you have a chance and when you *want* to do them. The point is also not  -- The point is to give you a familiarity and modicum of comfort working all across the stack, so that you can better understand the needs and challenges of the people that you're working with. 

Empathy comes in many forms, and one of the reasons different camps and schools of thought become so entrenched and even develop animosity toward one another is often simply the fact that they never took the time to see it from another perspective. 

Any time you leave your comfort zone, especially as an expert, and try something that you're unfamiliar with, you increase the breadth of your understanding, your empathy for the position those around you are in, and your humility: There's nothing quite like the feeling of being a newb to bring a high and mighty expert mentality back down to Earth.

This also allows the expert to treat the junior devs in their organization with much more respect. Feeling out of your element is uncomfortable, and it feels great when a mentor or trainer recognizes that, and makes you feel like you're allowed some wiggle room as you figure things out.


### Where To Begin?

Most of us who work in tech related fields were drawn to computers for as long as we can remember. We're a generation that was raised on the internet, and screens are as intuitive and natural to us as TV. But if you're anything like me, a lifetime of being the "resident computer expert" in my family and communities didn't neccassarily translate to a clear understanding of what I wanted to *do* with them. 

At first I worked exclusively with GUI programs on tangentially technological projects. Then a business I was consulting for needed some changes made to their website and I had to open a text editor for the first time since high school. I was immediately hooked.

Next I went through an in house IT phase, working with networks, hardware, and resolving trivial problems for execs while putting out fires for management. That introduced me to the command line and Linux, and by then I was really cooking with gas.

But I've always been an artist and a musician--aesthetics are not only important to me, they often define my experience. The subtleties of color, typography, shape, size, and alignment, are intuitive to me, and it gives me pleasure both to look at and create beautiful things.

That's when I took my first job in web development and apart from a brief stint as an executive at a startup in San Francisco, I haven't looked back.

<!-- > One thing I've learned is that there is an important balance of humility and confidence which, if properly struck, creates an environment where personal and professional growth can symbiotically thrive. But what I also have is the unshakeable persistence to see things through, which, when all other methodologies have failed me, is what I can rely on to solve nearly any problem I come across. And that's what gives me the confidence to speak from a position of understanding and expertise. -->
