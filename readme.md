## Introduction

 There are how-to's, walkthroughs, and "getting started" techniques scattered all over the internets--enough to last the aspiring developer a lifetime. A lot of them are good. I mean **really** good! [Tania Rascia's](https://taniarascia.com) blog comes to mind, books like [You Don't Know JS](https://youdontknowjs.com) or [Automate Everything](https://automateeverything.com), lists of [Awesome Lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome), even entire courses like [Harvard's CS 50](https://youtube.com/harvard) right on Youtube! There are thriving communities of experts--often the very authors of the code you've got questions about--who make themselves available in forums and subreddits, on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com), Slack, and IRC. 
 
 It's an ethos that's been carried and cultivated by programmers since the first vacuum tubes and transistors were cobbled together and called computers, enshrined and canonized by GNU, BSD, and the FOSS movement, maintained by countless unsung wizards of tech, scattered around the world behind the scenes and connected by the intangible connective tissue of the world wide web.

So why am I writing yet another resource list? Aren't there enough of them already? Well... even if there are "enough", I'm convinced that there can't be "too many", and that it never hurts to create another node. After all, isn't that the idea of a network? This list is more of a living document anyway. A scattered collection of resources and links from over the years that I've decided to organize and archive for my own reference. *If even just one person stumbles across this list and finds something useful, it will have been worth putting it up on Github instead of keeping it in some file on some harddrive in my office*. I hope you, dear reader, are that person, and that you find something that helps you on your journey.

Before I get to the links, I'll say a few words about the important ideas which shaped the community (as I understand it) and set the standards of what we now think of as as the free and open internet.

### Philosophy

One of the greatest things about tech culture has been the sharing of software, skills, ideas, and resources within the community. Without the generosity and idealism of the early Unix, BSD, GNU, FOSS, and Linux folks, the world quite literally wouldn't be where it is today. Open source software and its creators set a standard and provided a collective roadmap of software evolution, allowing us all to stand on the shoulders of giants, even going so far as to diligently maintain projects over the years, creating countless opportunities and careers for the rest of us.

A successful career in this industry requires an elasticity of intellect and a resilience in the face of insurmountable odds. It will put you in contact with so many technologies that your head will spin--at first. While daunting, you'll find your balance and a comfortable niche in the ecosystem from which to get your bearings. From there you can continue to branch out and explore the broader landscape, a process that once begun, never ends. 

There's a set of defining characteristics that make a developer/engineer great: An insatiable curiosity, a willingness to evolve over time, a tendency toward seeing problems as inherently solvable, a humility that allows them to pair the great work they do with the great work of their team, company, or the FOSS community at large, and perhaps most importantly, a steady methodical persistence in search of elegant solutions. 

While it's entirely possible to find that comfortable niche and stick with it forever, a true jedi of the art never stops absorbing evaluating and synthesizing information, never stops reading, learning, deconstructing, reconstructing, and making--even if the work they're currently doing to pay the bills is unstimulating or repetetive. They remain always in humble respect of the vastness of available knowledge out there. They recognize that the landscape is constantly moving forward, even as it remains at it's core an assembly of 0's and 1's.

### Software & Setup

There's no "right way" to set up a development environment. You find a workflow of your own over time, with hardware and software flavors that suit your particular needs. That said, there are shortcuts and tricks that, while seemingly inconsequential individually, will dramatically improve a developers productivity in aggregate. There are certainly plenty of things I wish I'd discovered months or years earlier, and to this day I'm adding, tweaking, and experimenting with my routines.

I would encourage anyone reading this to *try all the things* at least once, or at least all the highly regarded ones with large thriving communities. If you like Javascript try Python, If you like React, experiment with Vue, Angular, or Ember. If you love Jquery, build something with nothing but VanillaJS. If you're a backend developer, try converting a Sketch file into a responsive front-end UI, and if you're a die hard CSS stylist, make sure to fire up a Digital Ocean droplet, install Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, and configure a web server from scratch.

The point is not of course to derail you from a path or curriculum, or waste precious time if you're in the middle of a project with a deadline--on the contrary, you should do those things when you have a chance and when you *want* to do them. The point is also not  -- The point is to give you a familiarity and modicum of comfort working all across the stack, so that you can better understand the needs and challenges of the people that you're working with. 

Empathy comes in many forms, and one of the reasons different camps and schools of thought become so entrenched and even develop animosity toward one another is often simply the fact that they never took the time to see it from another perspective. 

Any time you leave your comfort zone, especially as an expert, and try something that you're unfamiliar with, you increase the breadth of your understanding, your empathy for the position those around you are in, and your humility: There's nothing quite like the feeling of being a newb to bring a high and mighty expert mentality back down to Earth.

This also allows the expert to treat the junior devs in their organization with much more respect. Feeling out of your element is uncomfortable, and it feels great when a mentor or trainer recognizes that, and makes you feel like you're allowed some wiggle room as you figure things out.


### Where To Begin?

Most of us who work in tech related fields were drawn to computers for as long as we can remember. We're a generation that was raised on the internet, and screens are as intuitive and natural to us as TV. But if you're anything like me, a lifetime of being the "resident computer expert" in my family and communities didn't neccassarily translate to a clear understanding of what I wanted to *do* with them. 

At first I worked exclusively with GUI programs on tangentially technological projects. Then a business I was consulting for needed some changes made to their website and I had to open a text editor for the first time since high school. I was immediately hooked.

Next I went through an in house IT phase, working with networks, hardware, and resolving trivial problems for execs while putting out fires for management. That introduced me to the command line and Linux, and by then I was really cooking with gas.

But I've always been an artist and a musician--aesthetics are not only important to me, they often define my experience. The subtleties of color, typography, shape, size, and alignment, are intuitive to me, and it gives me pleasure both to look at and create beautiful things.

That's when I took my first job in web development and apart from a brief stint as an executive at a startup in San Francisco, I haven't looked back.

<!-- > One thing I've learned is that there is an important balance of humility and confidence which, if properly struck, creates an environment where personal and professional growth can symbiotically thrive. But what I also have is the unshakeable persistence to see things through, which, when all other methodologies have failed me, is what I can rely on to solve nearly any problem I come across. And that's what gives me the confidence to speak from a position of understanding and expertise. -->
